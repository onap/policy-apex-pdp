 * executes the policies in an {@link AxPolicyModel}, which defines the policies that are executed by the engine and the
 * context in which they execute. Many instances of an Apex engine may run on the same Apex model, in which case they
 * operate the same policy set in parallel over the same context. When the {@code handleEvent} method is passed to the
 * Apex engine, the engine executes the policy triggered by that event. A single Apex engine instance does not executed
 * multiple policies in parallel, it receives a trigger event and executes the policy for that event to completion
 * before it is available to execute another policy.
