      "message": "In theory, you\u0027ll need the +x for other users other than apexuser to be able to do, \"cd $POLICY_HOME/etc/ssl\".   You may be OK provided that apexuser would own this directory, not sure, probably should test it out.   Traditionally the +x is needed to go into directories, etc .. (case ../etc/ssl), for regular files 644 is OK the change you made.",

      "message": "Yes, apexuser owns this directory, so there shouldn\u0027t be any problem.\nJim I think you are right. But not sure whether we should make these changes at this point. I would like to test these changes, because earlier also 45-47 lines were there. But still had to add 49-50 to resolve some issues that came up during testing. The main change was making apexuser the owner of the directory and that should be enough(probably 45-46 have to be moved down as you said). Still I think it is better to spent some time to test these changes.",
