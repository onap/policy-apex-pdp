/**
 * Provides a generic externally-facing {@link ApexEvent} class that can be sent into an APEX engine
 * and processed by an APEX engine. It provides the producer {@link ApexEventProducer} producer and
 * {@link ApexEventConsumer} consumer interfaces that APEX uses to send events to and receive events
 * from other systems. It also provides the {@link ApexEventConverter} interface that can be
 * implemented by plugins that wish to convert some external event format into the APEX event
 * format. It also provides a periodic event generator that can be used to send periodic events into
 * an APEX engine for triggering of policies to carry out housekeeping tasks.
