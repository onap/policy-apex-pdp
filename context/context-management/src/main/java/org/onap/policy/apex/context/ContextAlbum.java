/**
 * The Interface ContextAlbum is implemented by all classes that manage context in Apex. Context
 * albums may store context in memory, on disk, in a repository or in a mechanism such as a
 * distributed map.
 *
 * <p>A context album uses plugins to handle its context schemas, its distribution, its locking, and
 * its persistence.
 *
 * <p>
 * The schema that defines the items in a context album is interpreted by a plugin that implements
 * the {@link SchemaHelper} interface. The schema helper uses the schema definition to provide new
 * instances for a context album. By default, context albums use Java schemas.
 *
 * <p>Context albums may be shared across an arbitrary number of JVMs using a distribution mechanism.
 * Apex context distributed context albums using plugins that implement the {@link Distributor}
 * interface. By default, context albums use JVM local distribution, that is context albums are only
 * available in a single JVM
 *
 * <p>Items in a context album may be locked across all distributed instances of an album. Apex locks
 * instances on context albums using the distributed locking mechanism in a plugin that implements
 * the {@link LockManager} interface. By default, context albums use Java locking local to a single
 * JVM on each context album instance.
 *
 * <p>Context albums may be persisted to disk, database, or any other repository. Apex persists context
 * albums using the persistence mechanism in a plugin that implements the {@link Persistor}
 * interface. By default, context albums use a dummy persistor plugin that does not persist context
 * albums.
