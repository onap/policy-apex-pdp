      "message": "I had another look at this. The engineServiceFacade() code takes care of the cleanup if there is an exception so you are correct, there is no need ot call close(). The test cases were failing because the engineServiceFacade() cleanup is in a separate thread and takes a few milliseconds to complete. I added a delay of 100ms in the unit tests to give sufficient time for the cleanup to complete.",
